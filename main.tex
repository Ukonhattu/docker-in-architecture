\section*{Introduction}

What is docker? What is it used for? What are containers and why use them? Maybe something about how popular docker has become. Does docker affect architecture?
The purpose and the domain (what to use it for?);

\subsection*{A technical overview (what is it?)}

Techical overview

Kelasin, että kirjoitetaan tänne vähän tosta mitä se vaatii namespacea cgrouppia jne ja sit vois niiden perusteella analysoida noita quality attributeja? En tiedä. Mitä mieltä olet? On jotenkin vaikea kirjoittaa -ilities, ilman että käy läpi tuon techin, enkä kyllä löydä hyviä lähteitäkään. 

\section*{Docker Quality Attributes}

The qualities (-ilities) that the TUS claims to support (what?) and justifications for the claims (how?)
Based on how Docker is built, the system has some qualities hoisted in it. In this section we will 

\subsection*{Portability}
One key aspects of Docker is its Portability. With software portability we refer to the usability of the same software in different environments, such as the underlying operating system or hardware \citep{wiki:Software_portability}. Portability is achieved based on how the Docker technology is built. Each container includes all the dependencies required for the application to work and only requires an underlying operating system and infrastructure that supports the Docker Engine \citep{hy:DevOps_with_Docker}.
\subsection*{Security}
\subsection*{Scalability}
\subsection*{Maintainability}


\section*{What is it not suited for (any inherent limitations or reported issues) - may be challenging to research}

Perhaps

\section*{Architectural impact - what aspect of application/system architecture is affected by using it and how?}
yes
\section*{Tool support / automation provided (can be also from 3rd parties) to help application developers be more productive}
